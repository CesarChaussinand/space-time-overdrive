# space-time-overdrive
A short and quick shoot-em-up game made in five days for the interstellar game jam. The theme led me to this interpretation of space and time relativity.*
I hope you'll enjoy it !

This game is played with the keyboard only.

Thanks a lot to Quentin who helped me with some pixel art.
